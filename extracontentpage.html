        <h2><a id="theorigins">THE ORIGINS</a></h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Rugby World Cup</strong> is a men's rugby union tournament
          contested every four years between the top international teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tournament is administered by <strong>World Rugby</strong>, the
          sport's international governing body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The winners are awarded the <strong>Web Ellis Cup</strong>, named
          after <strong>William Webb Ellis</strong>, who according to a popular
          legend, invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game.

        <p>
          The tournament was first held in 1987 and was co-hosted by New Zealand
          and Australia. Four countries have won the trophy; New Zealand and
          South Africa three times, Australia twice, and England once.
        </p>
        <p>
          South Africa are the current champions, having defeated England in the
          2019 tournament final.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sixteens teams participated in the tournament from 1987 until 1995.
          Since 1999, twenty teams have participated in each tournament. Japan
          hosted the 2019 <strong>Rugby World Cup</strong> and France will host
          the next in 2023.

        <h2><a id="qualificationgrounds">QUALIFICATION GROUNDS</a></h2>
        <p>
          Under the current format, 20 teams qualify for each
          <strong>Rugby World Cup</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twelve teams qualify automatically based on their performance in the
          previous World Cup - the top three teams in each of the four group
          stages of the previous tournament qualify for the next tournament as
          <strong><em>seeded teams</em></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The qualification system for the remaining eight places is
          region-based, with a total eight teams allocated for Europe,five for
          Oceania, three for the Americas, two for Africa, and one for Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last place is determined by an
          <strong><em>intercontinental play-off</em></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          A visualised example of how this complex system works, has been listed
          below:

        <h2><a id="tournament">TOURNAMENT</a></h2>
        <p>
          The tournament involves twenty nations competing over six weeks. There
          are two stages - a pool, followed by a knockout round.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nations are divided into four pools, A through to D, of five nations
          each. The teams are <strong><em>seeded</em></strong> based on the
          <strong>World Rankings</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The four highest-ranked teams are drawn into pools A to D. The next
          four highest-ranked teams are then drawn into pools A to D, followed
          by the next four. The remaining positions in each pool are filled by
          the qualifiers.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Nations play four pool games, playing their respective pool members
          once each.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <strong><em>bonus points system</em></strong> is used during pool
          play. If two or more teams are level on points, a system of criteria
          determines the higher ranked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eight teams — the winner and runner-up from each of the four pools —
          enter the knockout stage. The knockout stage consists of quarter- and
          semi-finals, and then the final.
        </p>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          The winner of each pool is placed against a runner-up of a different
          pool in a quarter-final.The winner of each quarter-final goes on to
          the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final.
        </p>
        <p>
          Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze
          Final'. If a match in the knockout stages ends in a draw, the winner
          is determined through <strong><em>extra time</em></strong
          >. If that fails, the match goes into
          <strong><em>sudden death</em></strong> and the next team to score any
          points is the winner.
        </p>
        <p>
